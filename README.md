This was a project I led a team to build as one of the final assignments in the Le Wagon bootcamp.

Stack used: Ruby-on-Rails, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL.

This was a AirBnB clone, the purpose was the build a complete website that allowed users to browse, rent/rent out and make a payment for sporting equipment.




Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
